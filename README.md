# Custom_Calendar
Simple custom calendar.

The built in calendar control is very limited.  And if you want to do more, you have to pay hundreds for controls from Syncfusion and such.  

This uwp project is a simple custom calendar that allows you to do anything you want with it.  Code is very self-explanatory.  You can add your own code to right click on each cell and post notes and stuff.  Everything about this calendar can be changed to suit your needs.

Note: I'm an amateur programmer so this project looks nothing like what a "professional" programmer would do.  I own a real estate investment company and this calendar is part of a larger project I am writing for my company's internal use.
